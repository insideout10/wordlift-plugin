User downloads, installs and activates WordLift plugin.

WordLift plugin recognizes that the user is either on a Professional or Business subscription, or the user has the WooCommerce SEO extension installed.

WordLift installs and activates the ACF4SO and notifies the user that the ACF4SO has been installed and activated.

WordLift also checks whether the subscription changes or WooCommerce SEO extension is removed in which case the ACF4SO should be removed.

So that the prerequisites for ACF4SO to be installed and to be active are that the subscription is either Professional or Business or that WooCommerce SEO extension is installed and activated.

If the user later on deactivates ACF4SO, WordLift plugin will display a message like "WordLift detected that Advanced Custom Fields for Schema.org is deactivated and, you're loosing out on full Schema.org support. Click here to reactivate.".

If the user later on removed ACF4SO, WordLift plugin will display a message like "WordLift detected that Advanced Custom Fields for Schema.org is not installed and, you're loosing out on full Schema.org support. Click here to install and reactivate."'
