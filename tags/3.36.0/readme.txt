== Frequently Asked Questions ==

http://docs.wordlift.io/

= Who is WordLift for? =

**WordLift** is for all *bloggers*, *journalists*, and *content marketers* publishing and fighting for readers’ attention on the web. <br />
**WordLift** democratizes the field, bringing to the hands of all web content creators the technology that web publisher giants such as *Google*, *Facebook* and the *BBC* are using to organize and monetize their content. <br />
**WordLift** helps you create richer and more engaging content, optimizes it for all search engines and efficiently organizes your content creation process, allowing you to reach and speak directly to your tribe. <br />

= Why shall I use WordLift? =

Organizing web content around an internal vocabulary rather than traditional web pages helps both users and machines finding and accessing it, improving navigation, content re-use, content repurposing, and search engine rankings. <br />
**WordLift** **organizes** content, reducing the complexity of content management and content marketing operations, letting bloggers and site owners focus on stories and communities. <br />
**WordLift** **enriches** your content with *contextual information*, *links*, and *media*, from custom vocabularies and/or the wealth of open data available on the web, bringing your user experience to a new level of engagement. <br />
**WordLift** **connects** content with cross-media *discovery* and *recommendations* widgets, increasing content quality, exposure, trustworthiness and readership engagement. <br />
**WordLift** **optimizes** content, complementing the offer of plug-ins such as *SEO Ultimate* or *Yoast*, automatically adding schema.org markups to your text, allowing all search engines to properly index your pages and deliver more traffic to your site. <br />

= Can you prove that WordLift improves the online visibility of websites? =

We are on a mission **to improve the visibility of websites**. Testing the product’s assumptions by looking at the web metrics with a methodical approach, is a crucial part of our product development. <br />
We recently presented **a research study** and proved that **our semantic markup, annotations and widgets improve the number of visitors, the pageviews, the time spent on page and the duration of a session with a double digit growth** on an editorial website with around 150.000 monthly visitors.<br />
While not all websites are created equal, you can [download the result of this study](https://wordlift.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordlift-proceedings-paper-SEMANTiCS2017.pdf) and start testing WordLift yourself. It does work! <br />

= How does it work? =

To know more about how **WordLift** works, please [watch the step-by-step video tutorials](https://wordlift.io/how-it-works) on our [website](https://wordlift.io). <br />
**WordLift** works in subsequent stages. <br />

1. The first step provides a **full text analysis** and suggests concepts and relationships found in open vocabularies (such as *DBpedia*, *Wikidata*, *GeoNames*, etc) to help writers **classify** and **enrich** their content and structure it for search engines like Google, according to schema.org vocabulary. <br />

2. Writers can then create new entities, to complement the ones suggested automatically, and to be published as part of a **proprietary vocabulary**, acting both as a **reference** and a **search magnet** for their readers, according to the editorial plans. <br />

3. **WordLift** also assists writers suggesting **links**, **media** and providing a set of powerful **visualization widgets** to connect and recommend alternative content, to boost readers’ engagement. <br />

4. Finally **WordLift** provides means to record all these relationships in a graph database allowing search queries like *“find all contents related to concept_y and relevant for target_z”*. <br />

= What are the languages supported by WordLift? =

WordLift currently supports 32 languages: Chinese, Danish, German, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Ukrainian.

= Is there a free trial? =

Yes! All of our subscriptions come with a **14-day free trial**. If after two weeks you are not happy with WordLift, [contact us](mailto:support@wordlift.io) and we will cancel your subscription, no questions asked.
In addition, with the purchase of our 6-month or 12-month packages, we offer free additional months. [Check it out](https://wordlift.io/pricing/)!

= Who owns the structured metadata created with WordLift? =

**You do!** We believe content creators should retain the commercial value of their content and all the data they create and exploit it through **new business models** based on **content syndication**, **data-as-a-service** and a stronger **relationship with their audience**. <br />
You can open your datasets to the public, attaching to it a free or a commercial licence. Otherwise, use your data to feed **chat bots** on Facebook Messenger or Telegram, providing live feed updates on your activity and/or automatic customer service in real time.

= What happens if I stop using WordLift? =

1. If you stop paying for your subscription, but keep the plugin on your site, all the entities, metadata and pages you created with wordlift will still be available on your site - you won't be able to update it any longer, but they will still work just fine as they were at the moment you removed the key. The data you’ve created belongs to you and you can always request to us a data dump that is available in various machine-readable formats. <br />

2. if you deactivate the plugin instead, the vocabulary (metadata, entity and pages) will disappear from your dashboard, but everything you created is stored in your website Database in WordPress, and you will be able to download it, transfer it or re-activate it again anytime from the plugin menu. <br />

3. Turning off WordLift on our side, it would be like turning off all the keys and un-publish all the linked data you’ve created, not the plug-in itself, so it will be like #1 - you could get the data back from us and re-publish it as [linked data](https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/) on your own infrastructure. <br />

4. WordLift's technology is entirely open source: it takes development skills, infrastructure and some wisdom to nicely bring all the pieces together without our support. <br />

5. Your vocabulary (article metadata and entities) are published as [linked data](http://docs.wordlift.io/en/latest/key-concepts.html#linked-open-data) and you can always request a data dump in any of the following formats: RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, JSON-LD. <br />
