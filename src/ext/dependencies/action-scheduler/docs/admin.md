# Scheduled Actions Administration Screen

Action Scheduler has a built in administration screen for monitoring, debugging and manually triggering scheduled actions.

The administration interface is accesible through both:

1. **Tools > Scheduled Actions**
1. **WooCommerce > Status > Scheduled Actions**, when WooCommerce is installed.

Among other tasks, from the admin screen you can:

* run a pending action
* view the scheduled actions with a specific status, like the all actions which have failed or are in-progress (https://cldup.com/NNTwE88Xl8.png).
* view the log entries for a specific action to find out why it failed.
* sort scheduled actions by hook name, scheduled date, claim ID or group name.
