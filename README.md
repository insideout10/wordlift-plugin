## <a name="faq"></a> Frequently Asked Questions

### <a name="who"></a> Who is WordLift for?

**WordLift** is for all *bloggers*, *journalists*, and *content marketers* publishing and fighting for readers’ attention on the web. <br />
**WordLift** democratizes the field, bringing to the hands of all web content creators the technology that web publisher giants such as *Google*, *Facebook* and the *BBC* are using to organize and monetize their content. <br />
**WordLift** helps you create richer and more engaging content, optimizes it for all search engines and efficiently organizes your content creation process, allowing you to reach and speak directly to your tribe. <br />

### <a name="why"></a> Why shall I use WordLift?

Organizing web content around an internal vocabulary rather than traditional web pages helps both users and machines finding and accessing it, improving navigation, content re-use, content repurposing, and search engine rankings. <br />
**WordLift** **organizes** content, reducing the complexity of content management and content marketing operations, letting bloggers and site owners focus on stories and communities. <br />
**WordLift** **enriches** your content with *contextual information*, *links*, and *media*, from custom vocabularies and/or the wealth of open data available on the web, bringing your user experience to a new level of engagement. <br />
**WordLift** **connects** content with cross-media *discovery* and *recommendations* widgets, increasing content quality, exposure, trustworthiness and readership engagement. <br />
**WordLift** **optimizes** content, complementing the offer of plug-ins such as *SEO Ultimate* or *Yoast*, automatically adding schema.org markups to your text, allowing all search engines to properly index your pages and deliver more traffic to your site. <br />

### <a name="how"></a> How does it work?

To know more about how **WordLift** works, please [watch the step-by-step video tutorials](https://wordlift.io/how-it-works/) on our [website][wordlift]. <br />
**WordLift** works in subsequent stages. <br />

1. The first step provides a **full text analysis** and suggests concepts and relationships found in open vocabularies (such as *DBpedia*, *Wikidata*, *GeoNames*, etc) to help writers **classify** and **enrich** their content and structure it for search engines like Google, according to schema.org vocabulary. <br />

2. Writers can then create new entities, to complement the ones suggested automatically, and to be published as part of a **proprietary vocabulary**, acting both as a **reference** and a **search magnet** for their readers, according to the editorial plans. <br />

3. **WordLift** also assists writers suggesting **links**, **media** and providing a set of powerful **visualization widgets** to connect and recommend alternative content, to boost readers’ engagement. <br />

4. Finally **WordLift** provides means to record all these relationships in a graph database allowing search queries like *“find all contents related to concept_y and relevant for target_z”*. <br />

### <a name="what"></a> What are the languages supported by WordLift?

WordLift currently supports **32 languages**: Chinese, Danish, German, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Turkish, Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Ukrainian.

### <a name="data"></a> Who owns the structured metadata created with WordLift?

**You do!** We believe content creators should retain the commercial value of their content and all the data they create and exploit it through **new business models** based on **content syndication**, **data-as-a-service** and a stronger **relationship with their audience**. <br />
You can open your datasets to the public, attaching to it a free or a commercial licence. Otherwise, use your data to feed **chat bots** on Facebook Messenger or Telegram, providing live feed updates on your activity and/or automatic customer service in real time.
